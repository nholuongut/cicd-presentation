						<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
						CI is all about integrating code and making sure it works.

						<h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>
						Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration.
					</section>
					<section>
						This means that on top of having automated testing, you also have to automate your release process which will allow deploy application at any point of time by clicking on a button.

						<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
						Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery.
					</section>
					<section>
						With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

							- Less buggy product
							- Building release is getting easier as all integration issues have been solved
							- Whole team is reported about build process
						</textarea>

							### Continuous Integration - costs:
							- Team needs to write automated tests
							- Server for automated tests is required
							- Devs need to merge their changes as often as possible

							### Continuous Deployment - costs:
							- Testing culture must be at its best. CD process require the highest quality of tests
							- Documentation needs to be updated frequently to keep up after deployments
							- Overall process is knowlegde demanding and require experienced team

						<h2>How to prepare project for CI/CD?</h2>
						Following good practises is a good start...
						<img src="assets/process.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Use logger middleware for yours apps</h3>
						<img src="assets/console.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Use linters</h3>
						A linter will help avoid errors, and things that could not be errors (but look like them) or could be potentially dangerous.
						<img src="assets/linter.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Write at least basic unit tests</h3>
						These are the foundations of a well-designed CI.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Dependencies should have fixed versions, use `~` instead of `^`</h3>
						And don't forget to always commit at least one of yarn.lock or package-lock.json depending on which package manager you're using.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Use dockerfile</h3>
						<img src="assets/dockerfile.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Create a foundations for integration tests</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Prepare docker-compose.yml file</li>
							<li>Make use of ORM's libraries like 'sequelize'</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Jenkinsfile</h3>
						<img src="assets/jenkins-logo.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Uses groovy syntax</h3>
						<pre>
							<code class="hljs" data-line-numbers="3-6">
def hashPath(packVer, length = 16) {
    hash = sh(
        script: "date | shasum -a 256 | awk \'{print substr(\$0,0,${length})}\'",
        returnStdout: true
    ).trim()
    ver = sh(
        script: "echo ${packVer} | tr -d '.'",
        returnStdout: true
    ).trim()
    return "${ver}${hash}"
}

							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Let you integrate with 3rd party software</h3>
						<pre>
							<code class="hljs" data-line-numbers="4-8">
post {
    success {
	slackSend(
	  channel: "$slackChannel",
	  color: 'good',
	  message: "App successfully deployed - *(${env.BUILD_NUMBER}) ${env.JOB_NAME}* (<${env.BUILD_URL}|Open>)"
	)
    }
}

							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Easy integration with docker</h3>
						<pre>
							<code class="hljs" data-line-numbers="1-8">
  agent {
    docker {
      image 'node:10.15'
      args '-u root:root'
      reuseNode true
    }
  }

							</code>
